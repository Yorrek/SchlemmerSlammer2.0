    "### 2. Problem Description\n",
    "We thought about training an AI to recommend / create recipes based on given attributes (e.g. rating, certain ingredients (include / exclude), calories, sodium, fat, FODMAP, etc.pp.). The following graphic is an entity relationship diagram for recipes, which we created to get a better understanding of the nature and complexity of our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this would be a rather complex system to begin with, we decided to break the problem down, and start with a smaller application first. Thus we are trying to train a neural network to recommend recipe ingredients based on given ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Knowledge\n",
    "One of the more basic problems we face when we talking about natural language processing is that - in difference to humans - computers can just understand numbers, more specific ones and zeroes. It is not too hard to represent a language's syntax in numbers, but if we try to get meaning and context into language, humans are way better in understanding each other. The main reason for that is that humans often times have a similar context (background knowledge) so sometimes they even can communicate without words. To make this more clear, when we talk about cooking each human probably have a similar concept of preparing food in mind, but a computer just understands the word cooking out of it’s language context without actual knowing or understanding what it means.\n"

    "## 3. Dataset description\n",
    "### Source: https://www.kaggle.com/hugodarwood/epirecipes\n",
    "The Dataset is a collection of about 21000 recipes given in a .csv and .json format, where the json file contained all information of the recipes and the .csv file is basically a list of attributes and ingredients for all recipes. We opted for using the json file, which includes more context of the ingredients (e.g. 3 evenly chopped tomatoes) compared to the csv file (e.g. 3 tomatoes), which should result in a more complex model.\n",
    "### Processing the data:\n",
    "Because we put our focus on the relationship of ingredients, we preprocess the data from the json format into a textfile consisting of single line listings of the recipes ingredients, excluding special characters (see variable badchars in the code below.)\n",
    "#### Problems during preprocessing\n",
    "The first problem was that the windows command line could not process specific characters of the dataset, which first was solved by setting the command line charset to \"UTF - 8\" Unfortunately we just could read and process about 700 recipes, but not all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution to this was to do all the preprocessing through a python script (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem were the unwanted “bad” characters (basically all symbols that are not letters) and how to exclude them.\n",
    "Our solution is to check every single word for said bad characters and to replace those with an empty space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also we discussed whether to keep numbers (e.g. ¾) and measurement units (e.g. tbsp or cup), but we decided that our neural network would probably benefit from being able to put those aspects into context as well,so we kept them included. \n"
